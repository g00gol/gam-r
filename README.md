The GAM/r project is a participating entry to the DevCatalyst competition at theCO and was completed by Front-End Developer Jackey Yang, aided by Back-End Developer William Williams.

The GAM/r project is a fictitious website project featuring custom and optimized gaming mice. The audience was selected to be the customer and a great emphasis was added to the UX, usability, and appeal of the site. This, however, does not restrict our creation from a fully-functional back end and meticulous integration of PHP into our webpages.

The project will offer a grand introduction to both aspects of front and back end; further providing a greater elaboration on integration, UX, appeal, and functionality.
